5. Building Real-World Projects (Capstone Project)
Objective: Apply everything learned by building real-world applications that demonstrate proficiency in React.

Projects:
Project 1: E-commerce Website
Features: Product listing, shopping cart, user authentication, order management.
Technologies: React, Redux, React Router, Firebase/Firestore for backend, Stripe for payments.
Project 2: Task Management App
Features: Task CRUD operations, real-time collaboration with WebSocket, notifications, and filtering.
Technologies: React, Context API, Firebase or Node.js backend.
Project 3: Social Media Dashboard
Features: User profile, posts, likes, comments, search functionality, and user authentication.
Technologies: React, Firebase, React Router, Redux for state management.
Resources:

Deploy your apps using services like Netlify, Vercel, or Heroku.
6. Additional Skills for a React Developer
Objective: Equip students with skills that are essential for modern React developers, such as deployment, CI/CD, and code quality practices.

Topics:
Deployment:
Hosting React apps on Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting
Deploying to production with proper build optimizations
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
Setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Travis CI
Automating deployments and testing
Code Quality and Linting:
