Project Title: Smart Home Security System Using IoT

Abstract:

Background: The need for enhanced home security is growing as people seek to protect their homes from unauthorized access and intrusions. IoT technology provides an affordable and effective solution for real-time monitoring and alerting.

Objective: This project aims to develop a smart home security system using IoT devices to monitor and secure residential properties, providing real-time alerts and remote access.

Scope: The system will integrate motion sensors, door/window sensors, cameras, and a central control unit. Users will be able to monitor their homes remotely through a mobile application.

Professional Method: By leveraging IoT sensors and cloud computing, the system will provide real-time data processing and alerts. The mobile application will offer a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling the security devices.

Features:

Real-time monitoring of home security through a mobile app.
Instant alerts for detected intrusions or unauthorized access.
Remote control of security devices (e.g., cameras, alarms).
Historical data and activity logs for review.
Advantages: The system is affordable, easy to install, and scalable. It offers enhanced security, peace of mind, and convenience for homeowners by allowing remote monitoring and control.

Proposed Method: The project will involve setting up IoT sensors and cameras, developing a mobile application, and integrating the devices with a cloud platform for data processing and alerts. Testing will focus on ensuring reliability, responsiveness, and user satisfaction.
