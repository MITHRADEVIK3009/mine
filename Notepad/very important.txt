way to succeed in my thing is that 
  
focussing on one thing 100 percently by giving the thing what i want to focus on that thing  within short  span of time without disturbing my physical and mental health by maintaing my emotional things like family,friends and avoiding  xtra dopamine things like phone ,insta,and much more and evaluating my three catgory (or) circle of surrounding aound me and neutralising the negative energy towards me by giving equal and opposite positive energy towards that.

0)to prove myself to my loved ones 

REASON: thought about me                                                                                                TO CHANGE THIS:
i)dad  girl child,physically weak,cannot handle & protect our family either economically &                          DO EXACTLY AS UR                        
           protection from the all those stuffs                                                                           VISULAISATION 
2)mom-not known about family,anger one, physically weak( they are looking at this village sons & daughters so       BE CALM & get ur 
                                                       comparatively Iam week & also i am small &weak)          
3)paapu- u r not the person to understand her , u may not keep the things secret so she is not opened & don't want to open or even share the littile things ,After it became no need to talk to u (there is no use),
         but also at times there may be another reason could also be there , which is u may understand her.(she don't want to consider u ).
         And ,Since  at present the bad things and bad memories that u left with mom has influnced her much, u really need structure 
         ur memories with her by calmness & fun (i don't think fun will work out because she konws good jokes than u)        
4)goyyala- he is like u , at present he really loves u in many things except ur childish bahaviour in serious situation & anger in the fight(appa thatha) itself.


 
1)siblings future
2)siblings self improvement
3)future as my visulaisation 
4)to take care of my family from (bujoku)
5)to take care of my second circle family that will give an 
  oppurtunity to build my career & personal life 

POINTS TO REMEMBER:
1) u will not tell mental struggles to doing this or to get the things done to ur 1st circle of ur family || to anyone
2) remember that u r an option for those one in a way of utsukushi &ur dad in a way of protecting his family
3)don't ever give unasked advices for 3 circles of ur family environment 
4)u really need to explore the world & different kinda of people and summarising the things & their thoughts to be a prioritized,value known for things,well calculating,situationally acting   CEO (life)
