I believe that I am a right fit for this internship, since I possess all the skills which are required for this profile. I am an extrovert and love talking to people. I have been a part of the debating society of my college and have proficiency in written and spoken English. I will be able to effortlessly convince the clients to try your product and explain to them the benefits of using it. Also, I have command over MS Office and will be able to generate reports efficiently. I wish to have a career in sales and marketing and thus it would be a great opportunity for me to learn by working with your sales team. Looking forward to work with your organisation.
