Round - 01:
20 Questions in 75 mins. For me, there was enough time to spare, and I completed the test in just 40 minutes.
10 Aptitude + 10 Programming questions fill in the blanks that are no choice given.
Aptitude questions were Below the Intermediate Level.
Programming questions include deriving the output for the particular code snippet.
These were mainly C and Java code snippets which involved Recursion & Complex loops.
You can practice for these objective-type questions online. this is the zoho full stack developer round one things so giv eme Questions for my Mock interview for prepearation

Practice Tips
For Aptitude Questions, practice using online resources like Quantitative Aptitude practice websites or apps to improve your speed and accuracy.
For Programming Questions, focus on understanding the concepts of recursion, loops, and basic data structures. Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal to practice coding problems.
Mock Interview Format
Time yourself while answering these questions to simulate the test environment.
Try to explain your thought process clearly as if you were in a real interview.
Feel free to modify the questions or add more based on your needs! Good luck with your preparation!






You said:
is there any platform that take interview like google 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, several platforms simulate technical interviews similar to the interview process at companies like Google. Here are some popular options:

Pramp:

A peer-to-peer interview practice platform where you can conduct mock interviews with other users. It offers a variety of topics, including coding, system design, and behavioral interviews.
LeetCode:

Apart from providing coding challenges, LeetCode has a feature called ‚ÄúInterview‚Äù that allows you to simulate coding interviews, and you can practice on problems often asked by top tech companies.
HackerRank:

This platform offers coding challenges and mock interviews across various domains. You can also find company-specific interview questions and practice in a timed environment.
CodeSignal:

It provides a coding environment to practice problems and also offers mock interviews where you can solve coding challenges under timed conditions similar to actual interviews.
interviewing.io:

A platform where you can practice technical interviews with engineers from top tech companies anonymously. You can schedule mock interviews with real interviewers and receive feedback.
Coderbyte:

Coderbyte offers coding challenges and an interview prep kit. You can practice coding skills and participate in interview simulations.
TechMockInterview:

A platform where you can schedule mock interviews with experienced interviewers who can provide feedback and tips based on your performance.
Exercism:

While primarily focused on coding practice, Exercism offers mentorship opportunities where you can get feedback on your coding exercises, which can simulate some aspects of a technical interview.
Tips for Using These Platforms:
Choose Relevant Topics: Focus on the areas where you need the most practice, such as algorithms, data structures, system design, etc.
