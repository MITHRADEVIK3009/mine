Documentation Procedure for Design in Top MNCs
1. Initial Requirements Documentation
Purpose: To capture project requirements from stakeholders and clients.
Key Components:
Project goals and objectives.
Functional and non-functional requirements.
Business use cases and constraints.
Formats/Tools Used:
Requirement Specification Documents (e.g., PRD or SRS).
Tools: Jira, Confluence, Microsoft Word, or Google Docs.
2. Research and Analysis Documentation
Purpose: To document research findings and analyses that inform design decisions.
Key Components:
Market research and competitor analysis.
User research (interviews, surveys, personas).
SWOT analysis or feasibility studies.
Formats/Tools Used:
Research reports, UX research tools (e.g., Dovetail, Lookback).
3. Design Brief/Concept Documentation
Purpose: To outline the high-level vision and scope of the design.
Key Components:
Design goals and challenges.
Key performance indicators (KPIs).
Design constraints and assumptions.
Formats/Tools Used:
Concept briefs or strategy decks.
4. Wireframes and Prototypes Documentation
Purpose: To create and share early design drafts.
Key Components:
Low-fidelity sketches and wireframes.
High-fidelity interactive prototypes.
Annotations explaining interaction logic.
Formats/Tools Used:
Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, Balsamiq.
5. Design Specifications Documentation
Purpose: To provide detailed specifications for development.
Key Components:
Layout details (grids, spacing, alignment).
Typography, colors, and style guides.
Interaction behaviors (animations, transitions).
Accessibility standards.
Formats/Tools Used:
Design system tools (Zeplin, Abstract, Figma specs).
6. Design Review Documentation
Purpose: To record feedback and revisions during review cycles.
Key Components:
Initial design drafts with stakeholder comments.
Iterative updates and resolutions.
Final approved designs.
Formats/Tools Used:
Review notes in tools like Miro, Confluence, or directly in design tools.
7. Handoff Documentation
Purpose: To ensure smooth transition from design to development.
Key Components:
Detailed design handoff notes.
Asset delivery (icons, illustrations, images).
Links to design systems and style guides.
Formats/Tools Used:
Tools like Zeplin, InVision, or Figma Handoff.
8. Testing and Validation Documentation
Purpose: To validate the design during usability testing and quality assurance.
Key Components:
Usability testing scripts and findings.
A/B test results and analysis.
Bug tracking and fixes related to design.
Formats/Tools Used:
Usability testing tools (UsabilityHub, Maze), bug trackers (Jira, Bugzilla).
9. Final Design Documentation
Purpose: To archive and document the final approved designs.
Key Components:
Final screens and prototypes.
Design rationale and decisions.
Lessons learned and future recommendations.
Formats/Tools Used:
Version-controlled repositories or knowledge bases (e.g., Confluence, Git).
10. Continuous Updates and Maintenance
Purpose: To maintain and update the design documentation for future iterations.
Key Components:
Version history of design updates.
Retrospectives and post-launch improvements.
Formats/Tools Used:
Collaborative tools (Notion, Google Workspace, Microsoft Teams).
Best Practices for Design Documentation
Consistency: Use standardized templates and naming conventions.
Version Control: Maintain a clear record of design iterations.
Collaborative Tools: Use tools that allow real-time collaboration and feedback.
User-Centric Focus: Ensure documentation captures user research and goals.
Stakeholder Engagement: Keep stakeholders involved and updated throughout.
Accessible Design Systems: Centralize style guides, components, and reusable assets.
