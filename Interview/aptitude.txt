2. Letter and Symbol Series
Position Formula:
Convert letters to positions: 
𝐴
=
1
,
𝐵
=
2
,
…
,
𝑍
=
26
A=1,B=2,…,Z=26. For reverse order: 
𝐴
=
26
,
𝐵
=
25
,
…
,
𝑍
=
1
A=26,B=25,…,Z=1.

Shifts:

Forward Shift: Add 
𝑛
n (e.g., 
𝐴
+
3
=
𝐷
A+3=D).
Backward Shift: Subtract 
𝑛
n (e.g., 
𝐷
−
3
=
𝐴
D−3=A).
Cyclic Patterns:
Use modulo: 
𝑛
m
o
d
 
 
26
nmod26 for cyclic shifts (e.g., 
𝑍
+
1
=
𝐴
Z+1=A).

3. Statement and Assumption
Golden Rule:
The assumption must be implicit and necessary for the statement to hold true. Avoid assumptions with external facts.
4. Cause and Effect
Checklist:
Direct Link: If A causes B, B cannot happen without A.
Eliminate Coincidence: Check if both A and B have a common cause or no relationship.
5. Logical Deductions (Syllogisms)
Basic Rules for Statements:

Universal Affirmative: 
𝐴
→
𝐵
A→B
Universal Negative: 
𝐴
↛
𝐵
A

→B
Particular Affirmative: 
𝐴
∩
𝐵
≠
𝜙
A∩B

=ϕ
Particular Negative: 
𝐴
∩
𝐵
=
𝜙
A∩B=ϕ
Immediate Inferences:

𝐴
→
𝐵
A→B implies 
¬
𝐵
→
¬
𝐴
¬B→¬A (Contrapositive)
If 
𝐴
→
𝐵
A→B and 
𝐵
→
𝐶
B→C, then 
𝐴
→
𝐶
A→C (Transitive Property)
6. Analogies
Types of Relationships to Memorize:
Synonyms/Antonyms (big : large :: small : tiny)
Cause-Effect (fire : smoke :: rain : flood)
Part-Whole (wheel : car :: petal : flower)
7. Logical Problems
Work Formulas:
Work = Rate × Time
Example: If 2 people can do a job in 4 days, then 
1
/
(
2
⋅
4
)
=
1
/
8
1/(2⋅4)=1/8 work/day.
8. Statement and Conclusion
Key Rule: A conclusion is valid only if it directly follows the statement without any extra assumption.
9. Statement and Argument
Strong Argument:
Relevant, logical, and fact-based.
Weak Argument:
Emotional, vague, or not directly related.
10. Cause and Effect
Direct Formula:
𝐴
 causes 
𝐵
  
⟹
  
𝐵
A causes B⟹B cannot happen independently of 
𝐴
A.
11. Matching Definitions
Memorization Strategy: Learn definitions and examples of common terms such as:
"Ecosystem" includes "living and non-living components."
"Parliament" includes "members and legislation."
12. Logical Games
Grid Formation Rule: Use rows/columns for each element and eliminate options based on clues.
13. Verbal Reasoning
Common Connectors to Remember:
"Hence," "Therefore," "Thus" indicate conclusions.
"Because," "Since" indicate premises.
14. Analyzing Arguments
Key Formula:
Break the argument into:
Premises (facts, evidence)
Conclusion (what it leads to)
15. Theme Detection
Focus Rule:
The theme must be the central, repeated idea across all parts.
16. Logical Deduction
Venn Diagram Formula:
Use overlaps to identify shared and exclusive elements.
17. Course of Action
Checklist:
Practicality: Can it be implemented?
Relevance: Does it solve the problem?
While there aren’t formulas like in math, these structured rules and patterns serve as “mental formulas” to memorize and apply. If you want tailored tips for any specific type, let me know!
