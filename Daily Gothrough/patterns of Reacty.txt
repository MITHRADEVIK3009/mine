In React, patterns refer to reusable solutions or strategies that developers use to solve common problems when building React applications. These patterns help structure applications in a maintainable and scalable way. Below are some key patterns in React, ranging from basic to advanced:

1. Component Patterns
Functional Components
React allows you to write components as functions (since React 16.8, functional components can use hooks for state and lifecycle management).
They are simpler and easier to test than class components.
javascript
Copy code
// Functional component example
const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};
Class Components
Before hooks, class components were the primary way to handle state and lifecycle methods in React.
They are still used but are less common with the advent of hooks.
javascript
Copy code
// Class component example
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
Container and Presentational Components
Presentational Components: Focus on how things look, receiving data and callbacks through props. These are often stateless.
Container Components: Focus on logic, managing state, and handling data fetching. They pass data down to presentational components.
javascript
Copy code
// Container Component
const UserContainer = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser().then(setUser);
  }, []);

  return user ? <UserProfile user={user} /> : <Loading />;
};

// Presentational Component
const UserProfile = ({ user }) => {
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
};
Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with added behavior or features.
They are commonly used for code reuse and adding common functionality like authentication checks, data fetching, etc.
javascript
Copy code
const withAuth = (Component) => {
  return (props) => {
    if (!props.isAuthenticated) {
      return <Redirect to="/login" />;
    }
    return <Component {...props} />;
  };
};

const Dashboard = () => <div>Welcome to your dashboard!</div>;

const ProtectedDashboard = withAuth(Dashboard);
2. State Management Patterns
Lifting State Up
React follows the principle of lifting state up, where you move the state to the closest common ancestor component and pass it down via props.
This pattern is often used to share state between sibling components.
javascript
Copy code
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent count={count} setCount={setCount} />
    </div>
  );
};

const ChildComponent = ({ count, setCount }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
State Management with Context API
The Context API allows you to manage global state in your React app without needing to pass props down manually through every level of the component tree.
It can be an alternative to state management libraries like Redux for simple use cases.
javascript
Copy code
const UserContext = createContext();

const UserProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
      {children}
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
};

const UserProfile = () => {
  const { user } = useContext(UserContext);

  return <div>{user ? `Hello, ${user.name}` : "No user logged in"}</div>;
};
State Management with Redux
Redux is a predictable state container used for JavaScript apps, particularly in larger React apps.
It uses a global store to manage application state and follows a strict pattern of actions, reducers, and dispatching.
javascript
Copy code
// Redux store
const rootReducer = (state = { count: 0 }, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Action to dispatch
const increment = () => ({ type: "INCREMENT" });

// Component connected to Redux store
const Counter = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const count = useSelector(state => state.count);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
3. Performance Optimization Patterns
Lazy Loading
Lazy loading is used to load components or libraries only when needed, which improves the initial load time of an application.
React provides React.lazy() and Suspense for component-level lazy loading.
javascript
Copy code
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));

const App = () => (
  <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
    <LazyComponent />
  </Suspense>
);
Memoization with React.memo()
React.memo() is used to prevent unnecessary re-renders of a component when its props haven't changed. It’s a performance optimization for functional components.
javascript
Copy code
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ value }) => {
  console.log("Rendered ExpensiveComponent");
  return <div>{value}</div>;
});
useMemo and useCallback Hooks
useMemo: Memoizes the result of a calculation or expensive computation so that it doesn't need to be recalculated on every render.
useCallback: Memoizes a function so that it doesn’t get recreated on every render.
javascript
Copy code
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const expensiveCalculation = useMemo(() => {
    return count * 2;  // Only recalculated when count changes
  }, [count]);

  const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
    console.log("This function is memoized.");
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{expensiveCalculation}</p>
      <button onClick={memoizedCallback}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};
4. Advanced Patterns
Compound Component Pattern
This pattern involves creating components that are flexible and allow composition through children components.
javascript
Copy code
const Tabs = ({ children }) => {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState(0);

  const handleTabClick = (index) => {
    setActiveTab(index);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="tabs">
        {React.Children.map(children, (child, index) =>
          React.cloneElement(child, {
            isActive: activeTab === index,
            onTabClick: () => handleTabClick(index),
          })
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

const Tab = ({ isActive, onTabClick, children }) => (
  <div
    className={`tab ${isActive ? "active" : ""}`}
    onClick={onTabClick}
  >
    {children}
  </div>
);

// Usage
<Tabs>
  <Tab>Tab 1</Tab>
  <Tab>Tab 2</Tab>
</Tabs>
Render Props Pattern
A technique for sharing code between React components using a prop that is a function. This allows you to share logic between components while maintaining flexibility.
javascript
Copy code
const MouseTracker = ({ render }) => {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
    setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
    };
  }, []);

  return render(position);
};

// Usage
<MouseTracker render={(position) => <p>Mouse position: {position.x}, {position.y}</p>} />
